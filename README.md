UPnPTest allows you to stream your media onto your big TV screen with no configuration at all! Just throw in some files and UPnPTest will do the rest! UPnPTest supports a vast number of media formats and playback devices: From modern SmartTVs via set-top boxes or network-enabled stereos through to software solutions (e.g. Kodi or Plex) running on an HTPC, everything is possible.

*** IMPORTANT NOTES *** : Due to the nature of the underlying protocols, device vendors have a big area of freedom in implementing these streaming features. Therefor it cannot be guaranteed that UPnPTest fully supports your device. Please download the free trail version LINK before buying to see if everything works!
Supported file formats are determined by your playback device, not by UPnPTest. Please consult your device's manual if you are uncertain.
Playback performance is determined by the speed of your network connection, not by UPnPTest. WiFi connections might be too slow for high definition content.
